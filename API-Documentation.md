## Getting Started
You are provided with data about the lobby in the 'GAME' variable.
For example, if you wanted to see how many players are in the lobby you could do this like so:
```lua
-- Assuming 2 players are in the lobby with the following account ID's

print(GAME.Players) -- output: [827562, 1582]
print(#GAME.Players) -- output: 2
-- The # gets the length of a list
```

If you would like to see everything in the 'GAME' variable, go [here](https://github.com/stellarxoxo/nobodywillreadthis/blob/main/game.md). Otherwise, here is a list of common parameters.
